# Proofbound Monorepo

Transform your ideas into professionally formatted books with Proofbound's AI-powered platform and expert services.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install task runner (if not already installed)
brew install go-task/tap/go-task

# Install all dependencies
task install

# Start both sites for development
task dev:all
```

**Development URLs:**
- Marketing Site: http://localhost:8888 (Netlify dev with functions)
- Frontend App: http://localhost:5173 (React with Vite)

**Production URLs:**
- Marketing Site: https://proofbound.com

## Architecture

This monorepo contains two main applications and supporting packages:

### Applications

### Packages
- **`packages/ai-clients/`** - FastAPI server for AI service integrations (HAL9, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **`packages/cc-template/`** - CLI tool for Quarto book generation with templates

## Development Commands

### Core Development
```bash
task dev:frontend     # React app on localhost:5173
task dev:marketing    # Marketing site on localhost:8888 (Netlify dev)
task dev:all          # Both sites simultaneously
```

### Version Management
```bash
task version:patch    # Bump patch version (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
task version:minor    # Bump minor version (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0) 
task version:major    # Bump major version (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
```

### Setup & Installation
```bash
task install         # Install all dependencies
task setup:python    # Set up Python virtual environment
```

### Building
```bash
task build:frontend  # Production React build
task build:marketing # Production Quarto build
task build:all       # Build everything
```

### Testing & Quality
```bash
task lint:frontend   # Lint React code
task test:python     # Run Python tests
task clean           # Clean build artifacts
```

## User Flow

1. **Marketing Site** (proofbound.com) - Landing page with dual pricing
2. **Automated Service** ($49.95) - Stripe checkout â†’ AI book generation
3. **Elite Service** (Custom) - Direct link to React app for human-crafted books

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (for React frontend)
- **Python 3.10** (for AI services and book generation)
- **Quarto** (for marketing site and book templates)

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files for:
- Supabase configuration (auth, database)
- AI service API keys (HAL9, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Stripe configuration (payment processing)

**Marketing Site Stripe Setup:**
The marketing site requires a separate Stripe configuration file:
```bash
cd apps/marketing/_resources/js/
cp config.js.example config.js
# Edit config.js with your actual Stripe publishable key and price ID
```
Note: `config.js` is in .gitignore and should not be committed.

### First-Time Setup
```bash
# Clone and navigate to repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd proofbound-monorepo

# Set up Python environment
task setup:python
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies
task install

# Start development
task dev:all
```

## Development Status

### âœ… Production Ready
- **Marketing site** deployed to proofbound.com with Stripe integration
- **React frontend** deployed to app.proofbound.com with Supabase auth and account management
- **AI clients** with multiple service integrations (HAL9, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Book generation CLI** with Quarto templates
- **Environment-aware navigation** between local and production deployments
- **Version management system** with semantic versioning and automated deployment tracking
- **Logo navigation convention** for intuitive user flow between marketing and app
- **Unified development workflow** with centralized environment variables

### ðŸ”„ In Development

## Recent Updates

### Recent Updates (July 2025)

#### Account Management & Navigation
- **Header component**: Added comprehensive account management with signin/signout, user menu, and navigation between dashboard and book generator
- **Logo navigation convention**: Implemented intuitive logo behavior (black logos â†’ marketing site, blue logos â†’ React app home)
- **Environment-aware routing**: All navigation intelligently switches between localhost and production URLs
- **Mobile responsive**: Account management works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

#### Version Management System
- **Semantic versioning**: Implemented proper version tracking with `src/version.ts` and automated bump scripts
- **Version display**: Inconspicuous version display at bottom of main page (e.g., "v1.0.0 (Dec 7, 2024)")
- **Deployment workflow**: Simple commands for version bumping before deployment (`task version:patch/minor/major`)
- **Automated tracking**: Version and build date automatically updated with each deployment

#### Infrastructure Improvements
- **Fixed deployment issues**: Resolved gitignore conflicts preventing deployment of frontend source files
- **Environment variable centralization**: All apps now use root `.env` file with proper Vite integration  
- **Task integration**: `task dev:all` successfully runs both sites with proper environment loading
- **Supabase auth fixes**: Improved signout handling and error management
